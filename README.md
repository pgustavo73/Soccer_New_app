# Soccer News APP

I developed one Native Android app for the first time in Java, which I usually do in Kotlin. I was using native components like Android Jetpack, Retrofit, and Room. For this, I used a REST API of soccer news created in git hub pages. I use a new library to apply Dynamic Color Material Design 3 to make the app's UI match the device's theme color palette.
