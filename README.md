# Soccer News APP

One more achievement this time I developed one Native Android app for the first time in Java I usually do in Kotlin. Using native components like Android Jetpack, Retrofit, and Room. For this, I used a REST API of women's soccer news which was created during the project challenge at Santander Bootcamp Mobile Developer. I made some changes, for example, applying Dynamic color Material Design 3 makes the app's UI match the device's theme color palette.
